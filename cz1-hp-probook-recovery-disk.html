I wanted to install Arch Linux again with full disk encryption including /boot + UEFI, as I have done before on this exact same laptop (HP Probook 430 G5). I have written down how I did it the last time, so I can save some time the next time I want to set it up (which would be. right now). And well, for some reason the exact same steps that worked for me ~1 year ago, do not work anymore. If anyone could help me out, I would greatly appreciate 
Hi all, I have a windows server 2016 WDS server all installed and working as expected with a finished captured reference image. amp#x200B; When deploying i am using two unattend XML files for the installation. One for the server settings to tell the clients which image to use and one for the actual image specifics. It seems to action everything fine in both XML's apart from the domain joining process. Am i missing something in the XML files? amp#x200B; Appreciate the formatting makes. Update This morning, my computer asked again to install the feature update 1803. This made me furious, because it meant that it was ignoring the Windows Update Hider Tool that u/Novea suggested. Moreover, I couldn't cancel the update process, so the only option I had was to proceed. Surprisingly, this time IT WORKED! This has been the first time in two years that my computer has been able to install a feature update. I don't know why, because nothing has changed in my system during I'm trying to fix my HP Probook 440 G3. When I received the laptop it was failing to boot Windows, stating the bootmgr is missing. I thought a fresh OS install was in order. I made my USB bootable with a Windows 7 ISO via Rufus. The laptop tells me, "A required CD/DVD drive device driver is missing. If you have a driver floppy disk, CD, DVD, or USB flash drive, please insert it now. Note: If the Windows installation media is in the CD/DVD drive, you can safely remove it for this step.". # Background Information My laptop automatically boots into Startup Repair, and once it finishes "repairing", the laptop restarts and boots into Startup Repair once again, looping the whole process. The diagnostic and repair details ( from Startup Repair showed that the "root cause found" was that the "Boot manager failed to find OS Loader" , and the repair action for "File repair" and "Boot configuration data store repair failed". This is the second 
I have an HP Probook 4540s with 64 bit Windows 10 pro. It uses a Ralik Radio Model RT3290 802.11bgn Wi-Fi Adapter (based on the sticker on the bottom of the laptop and the device manager Properties for the network adapter) The laptop connects normally to my house WiFi, most cafe WiFi's (sometimes requires router restart to connect), and any hotspot. However, it "can't connect to this network" when I try to connect to my university network, which uses a user-specific login (each student Relatively long story ahead, TL:DR at the bottom for those like myself with little patience. So I was looking at benchmarks and hypothetical ways to spend money and experiment, as I do frequently, and I got down to comparing the Radeon HD 8650G in the Richland A10-5750M to the Intel HD 6000 in my 2015 MacBook Air. Not only did I find the 8650G outperforming the HD 6000 even in a best case scenario, but I realized that my MacBook is neither running dual channel memory or particularly Symptoms: When shutting down (or entering sleep/hibernate) system locks up. Power lights are on, HDD lights are on, wireless light turns inactive, fans and disks turn off. In Windows, explorer.exe crashes soon after startup but recovers quickly. This is consistent between installs, though not immediately in all cases. Events show the following error at the time of explorer.exe crash and recovery.  Faulting application name: IEXPLORE.EXE, version: 11.0.9600.16428, time stamp: 0x525b66. I'm running Windows 7 Home Premium on an HP ProBook 4530s(i3-2310m CPU - 64-bit). For the last two weeks my laptop has been running slowly, specially at start up time, and it has become much worse in the last two days, and now I need over 10 minutes from when I press the power button until it starts up and becomes somehow responsive, and it's literally getting worse by the day. When I run Firefox, for example, it will take around 5 minutes or so until it shows, the CPU usage during I have HP ProBook with Win 7 HP 64-bit that wont turn on in normal or in safe mode. Tried Windows 7 disk to run the start up repair but it could not repair the problem. Chkdsk /f /r from the command line did not fix the problem either. Also, tried system recovery but it says no restoration points found. The normal sfc wont run as system restart is pending. Tried sfc /SCANNOW /OFFBOOTDIR=c:\ /OFFWINDIR=c:\windows but I receive "Windows Resource Protection could not start the repair service". I have been searching the 'net but I cannot figure out how this is done. We have an older HP probook 4520s running windows XP. This machine was once owned by my wife's company but when they upgraded her they didn't want the old machine back. It has been sitting around for about a year and now one of my kids has been asking for a computer.
